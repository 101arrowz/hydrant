Students will do an semester long project in which they apply design tools/ processes from the course to solve a specific problem.","rp":false,"ha":false,"ci":false,"u3":9,"n":"Large and Complex Systems Design and Concept Development (New)","s":[],"tb":true,"re":false,"pr":"permission of instructor","br":[],"t":["FA"],"la":false,"u2":0,"rr":[],"hh":false,"no":"2.778","ra":0,"he":false,"cl":"778","si":0,"h":0,"lr":[],"mw":"","sa":"","u":"","u1":3,"hs":false,"f":false,"r":[],"l":[],"nx":false},"MAS.S68":{"cw":false,"co":"MAS","le":"G","pl":false,"b":[],"d":"Supplementary work in areas not covered by the regular curriculum.
