    Firehose does not store any of your data outside of your browser. Data is
    only transmitted upstream in one of two cases:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Google Analytics is enabled, which sends data on every page load.</li>
    <li>
      When you export to Google Calendar, Firehose sends calendar information to
      Google to place into your calendar.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    No data is transmitted otherwise. That means that our servers do not store
    your class or calendar information. You can disable Google Analytics without
    imapcting your use of the site, and if you never export to Google Calendar
    we never send your data anywhere else.
